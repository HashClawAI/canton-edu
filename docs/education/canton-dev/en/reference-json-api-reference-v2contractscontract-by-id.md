            a ``InterfaceFilter`` with


            - its party in the ``witness_parties`` of this event,

            - and which is implemented by the template of this event,

            - and which has ``include_interface_view`` set.


            Optional: can be empty
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/JsInterfaceView'
        witnessParties:
          description: >-
            The parties that are notified of this event. When a ``CreatedEvent``

            is returned as part of a transaction tree or ledger-effects
            transaction, this will include all

            the parties specified in the ``TransactionFilter`` that are
            witnesses  of the event

            (the stakeholders of the contract and all informees of all the
            ancestors

            of this create action that this participant knows about).

            If served as part of a ACS delta transaction those will

            be limited to all parties specified in the ``TransactionFilter``
            that

            are stakeholders of the contract (i.e. either signatories or
            observers).

            If the ``CreatedEvent`` is returned as part of an AssignedEvent,

            ActiveContract or IncompleteUnassigned (so the event is related to

            an assignment or unassignment): this will include all parties of the

            ``TransactionFilter`` that are stakeholders of the contract.


            The behavior of reading create events visible to parties not hosted

            on the participant node serving the Ledger API is undefined.
            Concretely,

            there is neither a guarantee that the participant node will serve
            all their

            create events on the ACS stream, nor is there a guarantee that
            matching archive

            events are delivered for such create events.


            For most clients this is not a problem, as they only read events for
            parties

            that are hosted on the participant node. If you need to read events

            for parties that may not be hosted at all times on the participant
            node,

            subscribe to the ``TopologyEvent``s for that party by setting a
            corresponding

            ``UpdateFormat``.  Using these events, query the ACS as-of an offset
            where the

            party is hosted on the participant node, and ignore create events at
            offsets

            where the party is not hosted on the participant node.

            This may differ from the package-id of the template used to create
            the contract.

            For contracts created before Canton 3.4, this field matches the
            contract's creation package-id.
